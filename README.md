# VALIS Algorithm
VALIS (Vote ALlocating Immune System) is an immune-inspired classification algorithm. See the [project homepage](http://inversed.ru/AIS.htm) for details. The algorithm itself is implemented in VALIS.dpr and Problem.pas files. The rest of the .pas files belong to the [InvLibs](https://github.com/inversed-ru/InvLibs) unit collection. The project can be compiled with Delphi or Lazarus.

The 'Datasets' folder contains the data used in the experiments. Normalization has not yet been implemented, so if you want to test VALIS on your own datasets, make sure to normalize the features to zero mean and unit variance first.
